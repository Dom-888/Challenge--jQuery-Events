## First Challenge

- Inside your script.js file, add a click event which will trigger when a \<p> tag is clicked and will change the color of all \<p> tags to red.
- When a \<h2> is hovered over, the background of all \<h2>s are changed to the colour lightblue.
- When a \<h2> is hovered over its font size increases, but only for that particular \<h2>
- When a button is hovered, the background color of the page turns black.
- When a button is no longer hovered, the background color of the page turns grey.

## Second Challenge

- Edit your html file to change all the \<a> tags to \<button> elements. Donâ€™t forget the closing tag and to remove the href attribute.
